## What Does This Plugin Do?

When someone fills out a contact form on your website (built with Forminator), that submission becomes a **lead**. This plugin gives your sales team a proper dashboard inside WordPress to:

- See all leads in one place
- Mark leads as positive, negative, or converted
- Add feedback and notes on each lead
- Track how leads are coming in over time
- Export lead data to a spreadsheet (CSV)

Without this plugin, form submissions just pile up in Forminator with no way to track what happened to them.

## Who Is It For?

| Role | What They Can Do |
|---|---|
| **Administrator** | Full access — dashboard, leads, settings, user management |
| **Sales Admin** | Can view all leads, update statuses, and add feedback — nothing else |

Sales Admin users log in and land directly on the Lead Dashboard. They cannot access any other part of the WordPress admin.
